# High-performance visualisation using OpenGL/WebGL
In modern data science, accelerated visualisation techniques are required to explore data sets in a robust way. This workshop will provide introduction to OpenGL, which is the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API in the industry, bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. In addition, it talks to compute platforms such as OpenCL or CUDA, and enables developers/scientists to create high-performance, visually compelling graphics software applications. The workshop will include introductions and hands-on exercises to basic concepts of hardware rendered graphics, shader language and also web-based version of OpenGL: WebGL. Short introductions to OpenCL and new Vulkan APIs will be also showcased.
