# OpenGL and Khronos Standards (Part 1)

Intro to OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, seting up the environment, using vertex and fragment shaders, passing variables to shaders.

# OpenGL Geometry and Tessellation (Part 2)

This part of the workshop covers the newer programmable stages in the OpenGL pipeline. The unique capabilities of these stages make them useful for a range of visualisation techniques. We will work from the ground up, starting with a "Hello Quad" example, towards increasingly more complex scenes, introducing various GLSL features along the way.

# WebGL (Part 3)

The last part of the workshop introduces WebGL from a ground-up approach. WebGL is a browser-implemented platform against the OpenGL ES 2.0 standard, bringing in a whole new level of accessibility of 2D and 3D computer graphics on the web. We will show the current state of WebGL support (nearly 90%), go through bare-bone examples of how to use WebGL using a popular library called ThreeJS, and showcase real-world applications using WebGL today.

You can access a WebGL-ready ThreeJS skeleton here: http://spaxe.github.io/webgl-workshop/index.html
